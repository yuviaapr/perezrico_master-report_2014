		\textbf{Abstract}
	\end{center}
		Genome-wide analyses of \textit{cis}-regulatory elements have highlighted the relevance of these elements in global transcriptional regulation. Among these \textit{cis}-elements enhancers have arisen as key regulators of gene expression. Recent publications have reported the presence of stretch enhancers in privileged regions of hyperactive chromatin in mammalian cells and tissues. Clusters of stretch enhancers, referred as super-enhancers, are characterized by a high abundance of master transcription factors, transcriptional coactivators and chromatin remodelers. Strikingly, super-enhancer targets include genes important for the establishment of cell identity, suggesting that super-enhancers could operate at the nexus of transcriptional networks that define cell states. Despite their important regulatory function, it is not known if super-enhancers exist outside of mammals. In this study, we generated enhancer maps for zebrafish and identified for the first time super-enhancers in a non-mammalian organism. In addition, we identified new enhancers and super-enhancers in mouse and human cells as well as adult tissue. Our cross-species comparison showed that zebrafish super-enhancers share key features with mammalian super-enhancers such as extension and association with identity genes. Moreover, we found that a considerable number of  enhancers and super-enhancers are conserved across distant vertebrate genomes. The enhancer roadmaps generated here set the stage for future functional and structural enhancer studies, particularly those focusing on non-mammalian vertebrates.\\
